# Machine Learning 🚀🚨

Machine learning allows computers to learn and improve from experience, discover patterns in data, automate tasks, and create intelligent systems that adapt and improve over time. It's essential for making sense of large datasets and has the potential to free up human workers for more creative work.

## Supervised Learning  

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the computer is trained on labeled data to make accurate predictions or decisions when presented with new, unlabeled data. 

### Classification

> Classification in machine learning is like sorting objects into different categories based on their features. The computer is trained on labeled data, which is used to create a model that can classify new, unlabeled data into one of several predefined categories.

### Regression

> Regression in machine learning is like finding the mathematical relationship between two or more variables, so we can predict a numerical output based on the input data. It's like teaching a computer to recognize patterns in data and make predictions based on those patterns.

## Unsupervised Learning

> Unsupervised learning is like exploring an unknown territory without a map or guide. The computer is given unlabeled data and tasked with finding patterns or relationships on its own, without prior knowledge of the categories or labels. It's like discovering hidden structures or insights in data that would be difficult or impossible for a human to find.
