# 💛 UNSUPERVISED LEARNING | K MEANS Clustering 🍒🍄

## Day 20 | Customer Spending Analysis 🙂

### Step 1 :  Find Problem 

- To categorize the information based on the amount spent.

### Step 2 : Collect Dataset 

- Input : Amount Spent analysis and segregate data as different groups.

### Step 3 : Load and Summered Dataset

- Import csv file from local directory.
- Summarize data.
  - Shape
  - Describe

### Step 4 : Segregate & Zipping Dataset

Here, we dont have labeled data. So, unlabeled data are going to categorize into different groups.

- Splitting dataset into Income & Spent.
- Combing those data into single variable ``X`` in the format of array.

### Step 5 : Algorithm | K-Means Clustering

> Definition :

K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering analysis. 
It partitions a set of data points into K clusters based on their similarity. 
The algorithm works by randomly initializing K centroids, assigning each data point to the nearest centroid, updating the centroids based on the mean of the assigned data points, and repeating the process until convergence. 
K-Means Clustering is widely used in data mining, image segmentation, and market segmentation.


### Step 6 : Finding best K - value and Fitting model to optimized K -value
